Notes (LogSeq + Syncthing) is your shared workspace. Start by reviewing your morning report.","/getting-started/first-day":"Your first day: review the morning report in Discord, open LogSeq to browse your journal, try prioritizing tasks with Ember, and respond to the evening check-in.","/getting-started/setup-checklist":"Verify Syncthing sync, LogSeq access, Tailscale VPN, Discord/Pushover notifications, SSH keys, morning report delivery, trust levels, Gateway status, and cron jobs.","/life-os":"Notes is your personal knowledge layer built on LogSeq, synced via Syncthing between EC2 and your Mac. It holds journals, projects, areas, and templates that agents read and write to.","/life-os/daily-workflow":"Daily rhythm: 6 AM morning report auto-generated, you update your LogSeq journal throughout the day, 9:30 PM evening check-in closes out the day.","/life-os/templates":"Ten LogSeq-compatible templates covering daily journals, morning reports, evening check-ins, weekly/monthly reviews, goals, research briefs, decision logs, and project kickoffs.","/life-os/logseq-tips":"LogSeq essentials: block-based editing, page links with [[brackets]], slash commands, daily journals, favorites sidebar, search, and block references.","/agents":"Four agents with distinct roles — Ember (Chief of Staff, L3), Scout (Research, L2), Forge (Infrastructure, L3), and Architect (Strategy, L2) — all using MiniMax M2.5 by default.","/agents/ember":"Ember is your Chief of Staff at Trust Level 3 (Autonomous). She manages daily cadence, coordinates agents, handles priorities, and can spawn subagents for specialized tasks.","/agents/scout":"Scout is the Research Specialist at Trust Level 2 (Act with Approval). He investigates topics, compiles research briefs in Notes, and requires your approval before external actions.","/agents/forge":"Forge is the Infrastructure Specialist at Trust Level 3 (Autonomous). He monitors system health, backups, Syncthing sync, and manages the EC2 instance.","/agents/architect":"Architect handles strategic analysis at Trust Level 2. Deployed for deep reasoning, complex synthesis, and system design decisions. Use /model to switch to Opus for maximum depth.","/agents/trust-levels":"Four trust levels: L0 Observer (read-only), L1 Suggest (propose actions), L2 Act with Approval (execute after confirmation), L3 Autonomous (full independence within scope).","/cadence":"Cadence is the scheduled rhythm of check-ins and reviews: daily morning reports (6 AM) and evening check-ins (9:30 PM), weekly reviews (Sunday), and monthly deep dives (1st of month).","/cadence/morning-report":"The 6 AM daily briefing synthesizes priorities, calendar events, overnight agent activity, and flags requiring your attention. Delivered via Discord and Pushover.","/cadence/evening-checkin":"The 9:30 PM end-of-day summary recaps accomplishments, lists pending tasks, and prompts reflection to set up tomorrow. You can reply with adjustments.","/cadence/weekly-review":"Sunday review covering completed tasks, carry-overs, project progress, notable events, and intention-setting for the upcoming week. Takes about 15-20 minutes.","/cadence/monthly-review":"First-of-month deep dive into goals, habit tracking, project status across all life areas, and strategic planning for the month ahead. Takes 30-45 minutes.","/architecture":"OpenClaw is a five-stage pipeline: Channel Adapters normalize platform messages, Gateway routes them, Lane Queue serializes per-session, Agent Runner orchestrates LLM reasoning, Execution Layer runs tools.","/architecture/channel-adapters":"Channel Adapters normalize messages from eight platforms (Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, Signal, iMessage, IRC, Google Chat) into OpenClaw's unified internal format.","/architecture/gateway":"The Gateway is the central daemon managing session routing, channel lifecycle, cron scheduling, WebSocket/HTTP API, and hot-reloading configuration without restarts.","/architecture/lane-queue":"Lane Queue ensures serial processing within each session (preventing race conditions) while allowing parallel execution across different sessions for responsiveness.","/architecture/agent-runner":"The Agent Runner orchestrates the reasoning loop: assembles context, calls the LLM, handles tool use, and streams responses. Supports model selection and automatic failover.","/architecture/execution-layer":"The Execution Layer runs tools (file ops, shell commands, browser automation, web operations, messaging) in a sandboxed environment with trust-level-enforced policies.","/automation":"Two types of automation: OpenClaw-scheduled agent jobs (morning reports, evening check-ins) and system-level automation (Syncthing, backups, log rotation).","/automation/cron-jobs":"OpenClaw's built-in cron scheduler manages five daily agent jobs. Distinct from system crontab — these run within the Gateway process and trigger agent sessions.","/automation/notifications":"Notifications flow through Discord (primary) and Pushover (supplementary) with three priority levels: Normal, High, and Critical. Channel Adapters handle routing.","/troubleshooting":"Common issues: missing morning reports (check cron/Gateway), stale LogSeq data (check Syncthing), unexpected agent actions (check trust levels), EC2 connectivity, and cron failures.","/troubleshooting/syncthing":"Syncthing troubleshooting: check sync status, resolve file conflicts, restart the service, and understand how Syncthing relates to the agent workspace.","/troubleshooting/faq":"FAQs covering agent access, EC2 downtime impact, adding new agents, data backup procedures, and OpenClaw architecture questions like heartbeat vs cron differences.","/reference/commands":"CLI reference for Syncthing, system commands, OpenClaw Gateway management, session/cron listing, service logs, and trust system commands with examples.","/reference/file-locations":"Key directories: Notes vault (~/.logseq), agent workspaces (~/agents/), OpenClaw runtime, trust system files, Syncthing config, and backup locations.","/reference/glossary":"Definitions of 33 key terms including Agent, Channel Adapter, Gateway, Lane Queue, Sandbox, Semantic Search, Session, Trust Level, and Workspace.","/reference/changelog":"Version history from v0.0.1 (initial infrastructure) through v0.5.0 (Notes rename), documenting major milestones and feature additions.","/implementation":"Current status: website deployed, Gateway running, cron jobs OK, trust system enforcing. Active work on semantic search and session handoff features.","/implementation/gap-analysis":"Comprehensive audit documenting critical gaps (templates, journals, linking) resolved via Phase 2.5 remediation, plus security findings and structural issues addressed.","/implementation/roadmap":"Phased plan from Phase 0 (Syncthing fix) through Phase 5 (future enhancements). Phases 0 through 2.75 completed. Current work in Phase 5.","/implementation/activity-log":"Chronological work log documenting February 11-14, 2026: trust system implementation, Next.js migration, Syncthing fix, and documentation overhaul.","/implementation/site-improvements":"February 14 documentation overhaul: 25 improvements (4 critical fixes, 9 high-value additions, 12 nice-to-have) integrating OpenClaw Architecture across all 39 pages.","/implementation/clawvault-analysis":"Analysis comparing ClawVault structured memory with Agent Team OS, recommending selective adoption of memory patterns while keeping Notes as the
