        <h1>Templates</h1>

        <p>Templates are pre-built Logseq page structures that provide a consistent format for common types of entries in Notes. Instead of starting from a blank page every time you begin a new project, conduct a weekly review, or capture a research brief, you insert a template that gives you the right sections, prompts, and structure from the start. Templates save time and ensure that important information is captured in a predictable format that the agents can reliably parse.</p>

        <div class="callout success">
          <div class="callout-title">✅ All Templates Logseq-Functional</div>
          <p>As of Feb 13, 2026, all 10 templates are fully Logseq-compatible. Each template has the required <code>template:: &lt;name&gt;</code> and <code>template-including-parent:: false</code> properties, and is formatted using Logseq's indented block structure (<code>-</code> prefix). Templates are insertable via the <code>/template</code> command. The Daily Journal template is automatically applied to new journal pages via <code>:default-templates {:journals "Daily Journal"}</code> in <code>config.edn</code>.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Notes ships with 10 templates that cover the most common workflows. Each template is stored in the Logseq vault at <code>~/notes/templates/</code> and can be inserted on any page using the <code>/template</code> command. When you type <code>/template</code> in a Logseq block, a dropdown menu appears listing all available templates. Select the one you want, and its structure is inserted at your cursor position. You can then fill in the sections and customize the content to your needs.</p>

        <h3>How to Use Templates</h3>

        <p>To insert a template in Logseq, place your cursor in a block where you want the template to appear and type <code>/template</code>. Logseq will display a list of all 10 available templates. Use the arrow keys or start typing the template name to filter the list, then press Enter to insert it. The template content will appear as nested blocks beneath your current block, and you can begin filling in each section immediately.</p>

        <p>Each template file contains two key Logseq properties that make it recognized by the template system:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>template:: &lt;Template Name&gt;</code> — registers the page as an insertable template</li>
          <li><code>template-including-parent:: false</code> — inserts only the child blocks, not the parent heading</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Templates are stored as regular Logseq pages in <code>~/notes/templates/</code>. If you want to customize an existing template or create your own, navigate to the template page in Logseq, edit its block structure, and save. Your changes will be reflected the next time you insert that template. The agents are aware of the template formats and will continue to work with them as long as the core section headings remain intact.</p>

        <h3>Auto-Applied Templates</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Daily Journal</strong> template is automatically applied to every new journal page. This is configured in <code>logseq/config.edn</code> via <code>:default-templates {:journals "Daily Journal"}</code>. When you navigate to a new day's journal page, the template structure (priorities, notes, accomplishments, reflections) is already in place — no manual insertion needed.</p>

        <h3>Auto-Journal Creation</h3>
        <p>A cron job runs daily at 00:01 UTC to pre-create the next day's journal file using <code>~/agents/ember/scripts/create-daily-journal.sh</code>. This ensures that journal pages always exist for the current day, preventing gaps in the daily cadence.</p>

          <div class="callout-title">Tip</div>
          <p>You do not need to fill in every section of a template every time you use it. Templates are guides, not requirements. If a section is not relevant for a particular entry, leave it blank or delete it. The agents will work with whatever you provide.</p>
