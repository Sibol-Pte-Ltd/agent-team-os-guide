        <h1>Forge — Infrastructure Specialist</h1>

        <p>Forge is the backbone of Agent Team OS. He keeps the system infrastructure running, handles backups and synchronization, and makes sure the automation layer operates without interruption. If everything is working and you do not notice anything — that means Forge is doing his job.</p>

        <h2>Role</h2>

        <p>Forge is responsible for system infrastructure, reliability, and monitoring. While Ember manages your daily workflow and Scout handles research, Forge watches over the technical foundations that make everything else possible. He monitors that files sync correctly between devices, verifies that scheduled tasks complete successfully, ensures backups are intact, and keeps the EC2 instance that hosts the agent team healthy.</p>

        <div class="callout note">
          <div class="callout-title">Scheduling vs Monitoring</div>
          <p>Cron job scheduling is handled by the <a href="/architecture/gateway">OpenClaw Gateway</a>, not by Forge directly. Forge's role is to <strong>monitor</strong> that scheduled tasks run on time, <strong>alert</strong> when they fail, and <strong>investigate</strong> root causes. To manage schedules, use <code>openclaw cron</code> commands or edit the OpenClaw configuration file — see <a href="/automation/cron-jobs">Cron Jobs</a> for details.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Forge is the most invisible member of the team by design. His work happens in the background, and you only hear from him when something needs your attention — like a disk running low on space, a sync conflict that needs resolution, or an anomaly that does not fit normal patterns.</p>

        <div class="callout note">
          <div class="callout-title">Status</div>
          <p><strong>Trust Level:</strong> L3 — Autonomous<br>
          <strong>Model:</strong> MiniMax M2.5<br>
          <strong>Workspace:</strong> /home/ubuntu/agents/forge</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Responsibilities</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Manages Syncthing synchronization</strong> — Forge monitors Syncthing to ensure files stay in sync across your devices. He detects conflicts, resolves them when possible, and flags you when manual intervention is needed.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitors scheduled tasks</strong> — The cron jobs that power the daily cadence — morning reports, evening check-ins, backups, and health checks — are scheduled by the <a href="/architecture/gateway">OpenClaw Gateway</a>. Forge monitors their execution, verifies they complete successfully, alerts you when they fail, and investigates root causes.</li>
          <li><strong>Handles backups</strong> — Forge runs scheduled backups of your Notes data and system configuration. He verifies backup integrity and rotates old backups to manage storage.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitors system health</strong> — Forge tracks CPU usage, memory, disk space, and network connectivity on the EC2 instance. He identifies trends (like gradually increasing disk usage) before they become problems.</li>
          <li><strong>Manages the EC2 instance</strong> — The cloud server that runs Agent Team OS is Forge's domain. He handles updates, restarts when necessary, and ensures the instance is configured correctly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Forge Runs</h2>

        <p>Forge's execution model is distinct from the other agents because most of his work is <strong>scheduled</strong> rather than conversational.</p>

        <h3>Sessions</h3>

        <p>Like all agents, Forge can have direct conversation sessions — for example, if you message him on Discord, the <a href="/architecture/gateway">Gateway</a> creates a session keyed to that conversation. These sessions work identically to any other agent: serial processing within the session, parallel across sessions, managed by the <a href="/architecture/lane-queue">Lane Queue</a>.</p>

        <h3>Cron-Triggered Sessions</h3>

        <p>However, Forge's primary work comes through <strong>cron-triggered sessions</strong>. The <a href="/architecture/gateway">Gateway</a> schedules Forge's tasks (health checks, backup verification, sync monitoring) as cron jobs. When a cron job fires, it creates a session in the <a href="/architecture/lane-queue">cron lane</a> — a dedicated lane type with its own concurrency budget. This means Forge's scheduled work never blocks your conversations with Ember or any other agent.</p>

        <h3>Model</h3>

        <p>Forge uses <strong>MiniMax M2.5</strong> (<code>openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.5</code>), configured in the OpenClaw configuration file. This is the standard model across all agents for consistency. Since Forge's work is largely routine — checking system status, verifying backups, monitoring sync — MiniMax M2.5 provides capable handling while maintaining cost efficiency. The model is invoked by the <a href="/architecture/agent-runner">Agent Runner</a>.</p>

        <p>You can temporarily change Forge's model using the <code>/model</code> command if a specific diagnostic task would benefit from a different model.</p>

        <h2>Trust Level</h2>

        <p>Forge operates at <strong>Trust Level 3 — Autonomous</strong>. He has an agent-specific <code>SOUL.md</code> with trust instructions that define his boundaries and escalation triggers. He can perform routine maintenance independently, including running backups, restarting services, clearing temporary files, and resolving straightforward sync conflicts. These are well-defined operations with predictable outcomes, so Forge handles them without asking.</p>

        <p>Forge escalates to you (via Ember) when he encounters anomalies — situations that fall outside normal parameters. Examples include unexpected disk usage spikes, repeated sync failures, services that will not restart, or configuration changes that could affect your workflow. Forge's philosophy is: routine work happens silently; anything unusual gets flagged.</p>

        <h2>How Forge Works</h2>

        <p>You will rarely interact with Forge directly. Most of his work is automated and runs on a schedule. Here is what a typical day looks like from Forge's perspective:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>3:00 AM</strong> — Run scheduled backup of Notes data and verify integrity.</li>
          <li><strong>5:30 AM</strong> — Perform system health check (CPU, memory, disk, network). Log results.</li>
          <li><strong>5:45 AM</strong> — Verify Syncthing status across all connected devices. Resolve any pending conflicts.</li>
          <li><strong>6:00 AM</strong> — Provide health summary to Ember for inclusion in the morning report.</li>
          <li><strong>Throughout the day</strong> — Monitor for anomalies. Run any ad-hoc maintenance tasks queued by Ember.</li>
          <li><strong>11:00 PM</strong> — Run end-of-day sync verification. Clear temporary files. Prepare for overnight operations.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you need Forge to do something specific — like check on a sync issue, run an unscheduled backup, or investigate a system problem — you can route the request through Ember, who will assign it to Forge.</p>

        <div class="callout note">
          <div class="callout-title">Note</div>
          <p>Forge monitors system health continuously, not just at scheduled check-in times. If disk usage spikes suddenly, a service crashes, or Syncthing loses connectivity, Forge will detect it and respond in real time. The scheduled checks listed above are for routine reporting — Forge's monitoring runs around the clock.</p>
