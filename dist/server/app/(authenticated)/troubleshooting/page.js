        <h3>"I didn't get my morning report"</h3>
        <p>The morning report is generated by Ember and delivered via Discord and Pushover. Each morning, the OpenClaw Gateway's cron scheduler triggers the process, spawning an Ember session to compile and deliver the report. If it didn't arrive, work through these checks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Check Pushover configuration.</strong> Verify that your Pushover user key and application token are correctly set in the agent configuration. Open the Pushover app on your phone and confirm notifications are enabled.</li>
          <li><strong>Check the OpenClaw Gateway cron scheduler.</strong> Verify the Gateway is running and the morning report cron job is active. Run <code>openclaw gateway status</code> to confirm, then check that the scheduled job for the morning report is present. See <a href="/automation/cron-jobs">Cron Jobs</a> for the expected entries.</li>
          <li><strong>Check Ember logs.</strong> Review the Ember session logs for the time the report should have been generated. Look for errors related to data gathering, report formatting, or notification delivery.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For details on what the morning report includes and how it works, see the <a href="/cadence/morning-report">Morning Report</a> page.</p>

        <h3>"My LogSeq data seems out of date"</h3>
        <p>If the data in LogSeq looks stale or doesn't reflect recent changes, the issue is almost certainly with Syncthing.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Syncthing might be paused or disconnected.</strong> Check whether Syncthing is running on both your local machine and the EC2 instance. A network disruption or Tailscale disconnect can cause sync to stall.</li>
          <li><strong>Check the Syncthing Web UI.</strong> Open <code>http://localhost:8384</code> in your browser to see the current sync status. Look for any folders marked as "Paused" or devices listed as "Disconnected."</li>
          <li><strong>See the dedicated Syncthing page.</strong> For deeper diagnosis, head to the <a href="/troubleshooting/syncthing">Syncthing Troubleshooting</a> page for detailed steps.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>"An agent did something I didn't expect"</h3>
        <p>If an agent took an action you didn't authorize or didn't anticipate, don't panic. Here's how to investigate and prevent it from happening again.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Check the trust decision log.</strong> Run <code>trust-system.sh log 50</code> to see recent trust decisions. Every check, approval, and denial is logged with timestamps, agent names, actions, and outcomes. This tells you exactly what happened and whether the trust system allowed or blocked the action.</li>
          <li><strong>Review the agent's trust level.</strong> Run <code>trust-system.sh get-level &lt;agent&gt;</code> to see where the agent currently sits. If the action exceeded what you're comfortable with, the trust level may be too high.</li>
          <li><strong>Demote the agent if needed.</strong> Run <code>trust-system.sh demote &lt;agent&gt; &lt;new-level&gt; &lt;reason&gt;</code> to immediately lower the agent's trust level. This takes effect right away — the agent will need approval for more actions going forward.</li>
          <li><strong>Check for pending approvals.</strong> Run <code>trust-system.sh list-pending</code> to see if the agent has other actions waiting for your review.</li>
          <li><strong>Review full system status.</strong> Run <code>trust-system.sh status</code> for an overview of all agent levels, pending approvals, and recent decisions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See the <a href="/reference/commands#trust-system">Trust System Commands</a> reference for the complete CLI, and <a href="/agents/trust-levels">Trust Levels</a> for how the permission system works.</p>

        <h3>"I can't connect to the EC2 instance"</h3>
        <p>The EC2 instance is accessed over Tailscale, so connectivity issues usually trace back to the VPN layer or SSH configuration.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Verify Tailscale is running.</strong> Run <code>tailscale status</code> on your local machine. You should see the EC2 instance listed as a connected peer. If Tailscale isn't running, start it first.</li>
          <li><strong>Check your SSH key.</strong> Make sure your SSH key is loaded (<code>ssh-add -l</code>) and that the corresponding public key is on the EC2 instance. If you recently rotated keys, the remote authorized_keys file may need updating.</li>
          <li><strong>Try <code>tailscale status</code> on the EC2 side.</strong> If you can reach the instance through the AWS console, check Tailscale from there as well. The instance may have lost its Tailscale connection due to a restart or network change.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>"Cron jobs aren't running"</h3>
        <p>Scheduled jobs power the automated cadence (morning reports, backups, etc.). The OpenClaw Gateway's built-in cron scheduler handles agent-related jobs like the morning report (spawning Ember sessions on schedule), while system-level cron handles backups and maintenance. If either stops, the rhythm breaks down.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Check the OpenClaw Gateway.</strong> Run <code>openclaw gateway status</code> to verify it's running. If the Gateway is down, agent-scheduled jobs (like the morning report) won't fire.</li>
          <li><strong>Check if a system crontab exists.</strong> Run <code>crontab -l</code> on the EC2 instance. If the output is empty or shows "no crontab for user," the system jobs need to be reinstalled. See <a href="/automation/cron-jobs">Cron Jobs</a> for the expected entries.</li>
          <li><strong>Verify the EC2 instance is running.</strong> Log into the AWS console and confirm the instance state is "running." If it was stopped (manually or due to a billing issue), neither Gateway nor system cron jobs will execute.</li>
          <li><strong>Check system logs.</strong> Review <code>/var/log/syslog</code> or use <code>journalctl -u cron</code> to see if system cron is running and whether any jobs failed. Look for permission errors or missing script paths.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>OpenClaw Gateway &amp; Agent Issues</h2>

        <p>These issues relate to the OpenClaw runtime — the Gateway, sessions, and agent execution. Understanding the <a href="/architecture">architecture</a> helps diagnose these quickly.</p>

        <h3>"Agent isn't responding"</h3>
        <p>If you send a message and your agent doesn't reply at all, work through these checks in order:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Check if the Gateway is running.</strong> Run <code>openclaw gateway status</code>. If the Gateway is down, no messages will be processed. Restart it with <code>openclaw gateway restart</code>. See <a href="/architecture/gateway">Gateway</a> for what the Gateway manages.</li>
          <li><strong>Check the Channel Adapter.</strong> The Gateway connects to chat platforms through <a href="/architecture/channel-adapters">Channel Adapters</a>. If the adapter for your platform (e.g., Discord) has lost its connection, the Gateway won't receive your messages. Check the Gateway logs for connection errors from the relevant adapter.</li>
          <li><strong>Check the Lane Queue.</strong> Each agent processes messages sequentially through its <a href="/architecture/lane-queue">Lane Queue</a>. If the agent is currently busy with a long-running task (a complex tool call, a large file operation), your new message is queued and will be processed when the current task completes. The agent isn't ignoring you — it's busy. Check the Gateway logs to see if there's an active session for that agent.</li>
          <li><strong>Check for model errors.</strong> If the agent's configured model is unavailable or returning errors (rate limits, API outage), the session will fail silently from your perspective. Review the Gateway logs for API errors from the model provider.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>"Messages are delayed"</h3>
        <p>If the agent responds but takes much longer than expected, the cause is usually the <a href="/architecture/lane-queue">Lane Queue</a> serialization model:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Lane Queue serialization.</strong> Each agent has a single lane — messages are processed one at a time, in order. If a previous message triggered a complex task (web scraping, long code execution, multi-step tool calls), your new message waits in the queue until that task finishes. This is by design: it prevents race conditions and ensures the agent has consistent context.</li>
          <li><strong>Long tool calls.</strong> Some tools (browser automation, large file operations, external API calls) can take 30 seconds to several minutes. During this time, the session is occupied and new messages queue up. The <a href="/architecture/execution-layer">Execution Layer</a> page explains how tool calls are dispatched.</li>
          <li><strong>Model thinking time.</strong> If the agent is configured with extended thinking or is using a reasoning-heavy model, response generation itself can take longer. This is normal for complex queries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>"Tool calls failing"</h3>
        <p>If an agent reports that a tool call was denied or failed, check the security configuration:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Execution Layer security mode.</strong> The <a href="/architecture/execution-layer">Execution Layer</a> enforces security policies on tool calls. Tools can be set to <code>deny</code>, <code>allowlist</code>, or <code>full</code> access modes. If a tool the agent needs is restricted, the call will be blocked. Check the agent's tool policy configuration.</li>
          <li><strong>Tool availability.</strong> Not all tools are available to all agents. Tool access is filtered by policy — an agent can only use tools that have been explicitly enabled for it. If an agent references a tool it doesn't have access to, the call will fail.</li>
          <li><strong>External service issues.</strong> If the tool call reaches an external service (a web API, a database, an SSH host), failures might be on the remote end. Check the tool's error message for details — network timeouts, authentication failures, and rate limits are common causes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>"Agent using the wrong model"</h3>
        <p>If an agent seems to be using a different model than you expect, understand the model configuration hierarchy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Per-session override</strong> takes highest priority. If a session was spawned with a specific model (e.g., a cron job configured to use a particular model), that overrides everything else.</li>
          <li><strong>Per-agent config</strong> is the next level. Each agent's configuration specifies a default model. This is what's used for normal chat sessions.</li>
          <li><strong>System default</strong> is the fallback. If no per-agent model is configured, the system-wide default model is used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Check the agent's configuration to see what model is set, and check whether the session was spawned with an override (cron jobs and subagent spawns can specify models). The <a href="/architecture/agent-runner">Agent Runner</a> page explains how model resolution works.</p>
